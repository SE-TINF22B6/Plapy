# 🤖 Plapy (Discord Music Bot)

> Plapy is a Discord Music Bot built with TypeScript, discord.js & uses Command Handler from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide)
> The project is based on a fork of the open source music bot evobot https://github.com/eritislami/evobot.
> Goals of the project are:
1. To add more functionality like saving and playing playlists from the bots database.
2. To provide an API for the user that allows control outside of discord command
3. To create a web interface that allows control via the API with a GUI
4. To improve the queue experience by providing new features like autoplay and play next
5. To host the bot and website on an external server enabling 24/7 access

## Requirements

1. Discord Bot Token **[Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)**  
   1.1. Enable 'Message Content Intent' in Discord Developer Portal
2. Node.js 16.11.0 or newer
3. Open port 80 (or the desired port that you configured) on the server that's hosting the project for API and website access
