# ü§ñ Plapy (Discord Music Bot)

> Plapy is a Discord Music Bot built with TypeScript, discord.js & uses Command Handler from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide)
> The project is based on a fork of the open source music bot evobot https://github.com/eritislami/evobot.
> Goals of the project are:
1. To add more functionality like saving and playing playlists from the bots database.
2. To provide an API for the user that allows control outside of discord command
3. To create a web interface that allows control via the API with a GUI
4. To improve the queue experience by providing new features like autoplay and play next
5. To host the bot and website on an external server enabling 24/7 access

3. Open port 80 (or the desired port that you configured) on the server that's hosting the project for API and website access
